Allows users to simply insert BuddyPress specific data into posts, widgets or theme files by using shortcodes.

== Description ==

The name of the plugin could have been <i>BuddyPress Shortcodes</i>, but as it's Bowe's idea, i named it <b>Bowe Codes</b>. This plugin needs <a href="buddypress.org">BuddyPress</a> and it 
allows users to simply insert BuddyPress specific data into posts, widgets or theme files by using the WordPress shortcodes API. There are 10 shortcodes availble in order
to display a specific member, a group, a list of members, the friends of the displayed or loggedin user, the groups of the displayed or loggedin user,
the messages and the notifications of a loggedin user, blogs of the network, posts from the blogs of the network.
Above WordPress Editor, a button will help you to configure your shortcodes. 
In BuddyPress admin menu, you will find the BCodes Options sub menu where you can disable the default css file to custom your own styles.

== Installation ==

You can download and install Bowe Codes using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download Bowe Codes manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/bowe-codes/".

Activate Bowe Codes in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Network Activate" (or "Activate" if you are not running a network) link.
