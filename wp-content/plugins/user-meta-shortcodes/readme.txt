Stable tag: 0.2.4
Use user meta as shortcode in post content without editing your theme files.

== Description ==

USAGE:

use [userinfo field="fieldname"]some content[/userinfo] or [authorinfo field="fieldname"]some content[/authorinfo] shortcodes in your post content to show the "fieldname" meta value from the user-meta for the current logged-in user or for the post author without editing your theme files.

EXAMPLES:

[userinfo field="last_name"]{{empty}}[/userinfo]

returns the last name of the current logged-in user. If no user is logged in then the value is empty string

[userinfo field="user_login" if="admin"]You are the admin[/userinfo]

this shortcode tests the field against the value and if true it displays the included content

[userinfo field="user_login"] is your username and you are reading a post by [authorinfo field="user_login"]{{empty}}[/authorinfo].[/userinfo]

this will display the username followed with the processed content. Note: never use the nested shortcode same as the enclosing shortcode. This will produce unexpected results!


List of some of the available meta field names: ID, user_login, user_pass, user_nicename, user_email, user_url, user_registered, display_name, first_name, last_name,nickname, description, user_level, admin_color (Theme of your admin page. Default is fresh.), closedpostboxes_page, nickname, primary_blog, rich_editing, source_domain

[authorinfo field="last_name"]

returns the last name of the current post/page author.


[authorinfo field="ID"]
