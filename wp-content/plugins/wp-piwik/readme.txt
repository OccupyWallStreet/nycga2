This plugin adds a Piwik stats site to your WordPress or WordPress multisite dashboard.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Piwik stats site to your WordPress dashboard. It's also able to add the Piwik tracking code to your blog using wp_footer.

**You need a running Piwik (at least 1.9) installation** and at least view access to your stats. Also PHP 5 or higher is strictly required.

Look at the [Piwik website](http://piwik.org/) to get further information about Piwik.

*This plugin is not created or provided by the Piwik project team.*

Languages: English, German, Albanian, Azerbaijani, Belorussian, Dutch, French, Greek, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Persian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian

*Note: If you vote "It's broken", please tell me about your problem. It's hard to fix a bug I don't know about! ;-)*

= Shortcodes =
You can use following shortcodes if activated:

    [wp-piwik module="overview" title="" period="day" date="yesterday"]
Shows overview table like WP-Piwik's overview dashboard. See Piwik API documentation on VisitsSummary.get to get more information on period and day. Multiple data arrays will be cumulated. If you fill the title attribute, its content will be shown in the table's title.

    [wp-piwik module="opt-out" language="en" width="100%" height="200px"]
Shows the Piwik opt-out Iframe. You can change the Iframe's language by the language attribute (e.g. de for German language) and its width and height using the corresponding attributes.

	[wp-piwik]
is equal to *[wp-piwik module="overview" title="" period="day" date="yesterday"]*.

More shortcodes will follow soon.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the Piwik URL and the Piwik auth token? =

WP-Piwik requires Piwik. If you did not install Piwik yet, first get it at the [Piwik website](http://www.piwik.org). 

If Piwik works, you'll be able to configure WP-Piwik: The Piwik URL is the same URL you use to access your Piwik, e.g. for the demo site: http://demo.piwik.org. The auth token is some kind of secret password, which allows WP-Piwik to get the necessary data from Piwik. The super user's auth token, i.e. a full access password for your Piwik, can be found on Piwik's API site. You can find a detailed description [here](http://peepbo.de/board/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=10).

= How to reset/remove all WP-Piwik settings without uninstalling? =

Login to your admin dashboard and open http://YOUR_BLOG_URL/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-piwik/wp-piwik.php&tab=support&mode=resetconfirmed&full=1

= Tracking does not work on HostGator! =

Try to enable the "avoid mod_security" option (WP-Piwik settings, Tracking tab) or create a mod_security whitelist.

= WP-Piwik does not work with SSL! =

See [this support thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-piwik-https-ssl-support?replies=3).

== Installation ==

= Install WP-Piwik on a simple WordPress blog =

1. Upload the full `wp-piwik` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. 

3. Open the new 'Settings/WP-Piwik Settings' menu, enter your Piwik base URL and your auth token. Save settings.

4. If you have view access to multiple site stats and did not enable "auto config", choose your blog and save settings again.

5. Look at 'Dashboard/WP-Piwik' to get your site stats.

= Install WP-Piwik on a WordPress blog network (WPMU/WP multisite) =

There are two differents methods to use WP-Piwik in a multisite environment:
* As a Site Specific Plugin it behaves like a plugin installed on a simple WordPress blog. Each user can enable, configure and use WP-Piwik on his own. Users can even use their own Piwik instances (and accordingly they have to). 
* Using WP-Piwik as a Network Plugin equates to a central approach. A single Piwik instance is used and the site admin configures the plugin completely. Users are just allowed to see their own statistics, site admins can see each blog's stats.

*Site Specific Plugin*

Just add WP-Piwik to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable the Plugins page for individual site administrators. Each user has to enable and configure WP-Piwik on his own if he want to use the plugin.

*Network Plugin*

The Network Plugin support is still experimental. Please test it on your own (e.g. using a local copy of your WP multisite) before you use it in an user context.

Add WP-Piwik to your /wp-content/plugins folder and enable it as [Network Plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins). Users can access their own statistics, site admins can access each blog's statistics and the plugin's configuration.
