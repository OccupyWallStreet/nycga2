<br />

Customize it afterwards in your Widget Area!<br />


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<strong>Is there a detailed reference manual coming with the widget?</strong><br />
All you have to know about customizing and setting the widget is written in the manual. The pdf-manual is available in a German and English version. Just follow the help-links in the control panel.<br />
<br /><strong>How can i install the widget more than one time?</strong><br />
That&acute;s very easy! Just have a quick look into the manual!<br />
<br /><strong>Where can i get additional image sets?</strong><br />
There are lots to be finding on the net. A few can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.go-gadget-blog.com">www.go-gadget-blog.com</a><br />
<br /><strong>How can I use the Shortcodes? I cant find the Shortcode Plugin?</strong><br />
I'd like to recommend to have a look in the manual first. (I hope that) All you have to know is written down there! The manual can be downlaoded at <a href="http://www.go-gadget-blog.com">www.go-gadget-blog.com</a> or directly from the control panel (follow the "help" links there)!<br />
<br /><strong>What is the Auto-Location-Feature?</strong><br />
If you don&acute;t want to show the weather for a given location and want to surprise your site visitors by showing their weather, this is the option to choose! The weather widget will then locate users home by some free geolocation services and present the weather and a forecast from there!<a href="http://www.go-gadget-blog.com">www.go-gadget-blog.com</a><br />
<br /><strong>Does the widget slow down my side? How can I prevent this?</strong>
The weather of a given location normally doesn&acute;t change every minute! So allow the widget to cache the weather data for approximately an hour. This helps in two things: The server of weather.com doesn&acute;t have to handle too many quests for weather data and your site should speed up a little bit, because your user will see the cached data! 
Nevertheless, if you decide to use the auto-location-feature it doesn&acute;t make any sense to cache the weather data, it has to be produced every time your visitors show up. So you can&acute;t avoid this traffic. 
You neither can avoid, that the widget have to get all the information about your user&acute;s location. This needs a further connection to three, up to four additional servers all over the world. If this slows your server and the connection down too much, i am sorry, but then you should consider not using this feature.

== Upgrade Notice ==

If you upgrade from a previous version - please refer to the Installation section of this text 
<strong>Why should you upgrade?</strong>
You simply have to upgrade, because the weather data stream of weather.com - which was used by the widget prior 4.0 - will stop working in short. Weather.com has decided to earn money with this weather data services. To keep the Widget free frmom charges, I decided not to use this stream any longer!
