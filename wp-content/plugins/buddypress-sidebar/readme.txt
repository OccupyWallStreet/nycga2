This plugin enables you to have multiple sidebars for Buddypress. Create new sidebars that are unique to each page.  



== Description ==



Create multiple sidebars, just name your new sidebar the same name as the Buddypress Component and it will show up when that component is displayed.  So you can have separate sidebars for 'Activity', 'Members', 'Groups', etc.  You can also name a sidebar the same name as any page and that sidebar will automatically show up on that page.  Prefabricated sidebars include Home and Blog.  The Blog sidebar will appear on single and archive blog pages.



== Installation ==



1. Upload `buddypress-sidebar` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress



Instructions: 



Note: This plugin is for extending the functionality of Buddypress.  Buddypress must be installed.



1. Install the plugin

2. From the Wordpress dashboard navigate to the plugin settings via the Buddypress sidebar link/icon.  Then click on BP Sidebar.

3. Use the default sidebars or enter a comma separated list of your own.

4. Chose the option 'Display below the default Buddypress Sidebar widget' to show your sidebars under instead of above the default 'Buddypress Sidebar Widget'.

5. You can create a page in Wordpress and then create a new 'BP Sidebar' with the same name.  This will enable you to have a unique sidebar on that one page.
