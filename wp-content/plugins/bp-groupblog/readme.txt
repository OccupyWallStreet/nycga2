BuddyPress Groupblog extends the group functionality by enabling the group to have a single blog associated with it.

== Description ==

The BuddyPress Groupblog plugin extends the group functionality by enabling each group to have a single blog associated with it. Group members are automatically added to the blog and will have blog roles as set by the groupblog admin settings.

**Features:**

* P2 integration and frontend posting.
* Admin can set Template specific groupblogs.
* Allow group admins choose the desired template page themselves.
* Full blog theme integration. The included bp-groupblog theme mimics the group pages.
* Automated blog registration at group creation stage.
* Bypass default blog validation to allow dashes, underscores, numeral only and minimum character count.
* Blog privacy settings are initially inherited from group privacy settings.
* Group members are automatically added to the blog.
* Blog roles match group roles as set by the group admin.
* Solid error checking that the blog follows validation.
* Group admin tab to access the group-blog settings.
* Blog themes will have the ability to pull in group info and create a theme that could resemble the group exactly.
* Leaving the group will downgrade the member role to 'subscriber'.
* Allow the group admin to select one of his/her existing blogs.
* A new ajax backend.

== Installation ==

1) unzip the bp-groupblog.zip file into `/wp-contents/plugins/bp-groupblog`

2) move all the themes in `bp-groupblog/themes/` to your WP themes folder

3) activate the plugin

4) run through the admin setup options

5) You are done!

== Other Notes ==

**Known Issues:**

* In order for Group Avatars to show on blogs please adjust the bp-core-avatars.php file. I realize this is a nono, but I don't see another way. Patches and ideas are welcome. For know adjust the last two functions for plugins/buddypress/bp-core/bp-core-avatars.php to the following:

`
/**
 * bp_core_avatar_upload_path()
 *
 * Returns the absolute upload path for the WP installation
 *
 * @global object $current_blog Current blog information
 * @uses wp_upload_dir To get upload directory info
 * @return string Absolute path to WP upload directory
 */
function bp_core_avatar_upload_path() {
	global $current_blog;

	// Get upload directory information from current site
	$upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();

	// If multisite, and current blog does not match root blog, make adjustments
	if ( bp_core_is_multisite() && BP_ROOT_BLOG != $current_blog->blog_id )
		$upload_dir['basedir'] = WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/uploads/';

	return apply_filters( 'bp_core_avatar_upload_path', $upload_dir['basedir'] );
}

/**
 * bp_core_avatar_url()
 *
 * Returns the raw base URL for root site upload location
 *
 * @global object $current_blog Current blog information
 * @uses wp_upload_dir To get upload directory info
 * @return string Full URL to current upload location
 */
function bp_core_avatar_url() {
	global $current_blog;

	// Get upload directory information from current site
	$upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();

	// If multisite, and current blog does not match root blog, make adjustments
	if ( bp_core_is_multisite() && BP_ROOT_BLOG != $current_blog->blog_id )
		$upload_dir['baseurl'] = WP_CONTENT_URL . '/uploads';

	return apply_filters( 'bp_core_avatar_url', $upload_dir['baseurl'] );
}
