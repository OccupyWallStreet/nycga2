= Why is there no UI for adding custom posts? =
This plugin is aimed at developers wanting to extend BuddyPress and provides a function to allow for easy 
integration of custom post types and the buddypress frontend instead of having to reinvent the wheel every
time; there are no plans for making a UI to map custom posts to custom components at this point of time.

= Why? =
Because.
