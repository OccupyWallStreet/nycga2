This folder contains email templates or parts of email templates that would be used in emails.

Any of these files in this folder can be individually overriden in your theme folder, making it upgrade safe without having to hack core plugin files directly.

To override a file, copy (not move) the file to wp-content/themes/yourtheme/plugins/events-manager/emails/ and edit as needed. 

If the file is within a subfolder of this directory, create that subdirectory in your theme path above and copy the file there.

Whilst we intend to keep changes to a minimum, it may be inevitable that we need to update these files to add new features or fix a 
reported bug, please keep this in mind when updating.
