WPtouch: A simple, powerful and elegant mobile theme for your website.

== Description ==

WPtouch automatically transforms your WordPress website into an application-like theme, complete with ajax loading articles and effects when viewed from the most popular mobile web browsing devices like the iPhone, iPod touch, Android mobile devices, Palm Pre/Pixi and BlackBerry OS6 mobile devices.

The admin panel allows you to customize many aspects of its appearance, and deliver a fast, user-friendly and stylish version of your site to touch mobile visitors, without modifying *a single bit of code* (or affecting) your regular desktop theme.

The theme also includes the ability for visitors to switch between *WPtouch* view and your site's regular theme.

*Now includes .pot file for translations (submit yours @ http://www.bravenewcode.com/contact)*

*Now Available: WPtouch Pro!*
Totally re-written top to bottom, with a slew of new features like more style, color and branding customizations, themes, 10 languages, more advertising options, Web-Application mode, and more!

Awesome iPad theme support is now available in WPtouch Pro, now at version 2.6!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I thought most touch smartphones show my website fine the way it is now? =

Yes, that's true in general. However *not all websites are created equal, with some sites significantly failing to translate well in small mobile device viewports. 

Many WordPress sites today also make heavy use of a variety of javascript, css and image files which significantly increase load times, in turn driving visitors on data connections crazy, often causing them to abandon your site altogether. 

So we created *WPtouch* to be a lightweight, fast-loading, feature-rich mobile plugin to add a theme shown to mobile visitors. The plugin includes an admin panel for customizing many aspects of your site's presentation when showing the mobile theme.

= Well, what if my users don't like it and want to see my regular site? =

There's a theme switch in the footer area of *WPtouch* for your visitors to easily switch between the *WPtouch* view and your site's regular appearance. 

We even automatically put a little snippet of code into your current desktop theme which will be shown only to iPhone, iPod touch, Android or BlackBerry touch mobile device visitors, giving them control to switch between the two themes easily.

= Will it slow down my blog, or increase my server load? =

No. The entire *WPtouch* footprint is small. In fact, it should reduce load, because of its streamlined approach to serving optimized content to mobile visitors. It was designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your site's content in a richly presented way, sparing no essential features like search, login, categories, tags, comments etc.
