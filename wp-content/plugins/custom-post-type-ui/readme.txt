== Installation ==

1. Upload the Custom Post Type UI folder to the plugins directory in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin
3. Navigate to the Custom Post Type UI Menu

That's it! Now you can easily start creating custom post types and taxonomies in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add custom meta boxes to my custom post types? =

The More Fields plugin does a great job at creating custom meta boxes and fully supports custom post types: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-fields/

= I changed my custom post type name and now I can't get to my posts =

You can either change the custom post type name back to the original name or try the Post Type Switcher plugin here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-type-switcher/

= I upgraded the plugin and all of my custom post types broke =

v0.5 reworked how custom post types are stored.  You need to delete and recreate your post types.  You will NOT lose any content by doing this.

= I receive a 404 error when viewing custom post type content =

This is usually caused if the rewrite slug was changed.  To fix this issue simply visit Settings > Permalinks to flush the rewrite rules in WordPress

= Will this work in previous version of WordPress =

The register_post_type function was added in WordPress 2.9 so technically it should work in 2.9, but there is no admin menu UI so all post types are created and used behind the scenes.

= I'm getting an error: Undefined offset =

v0.3 reworked how custom taxonomies are stored.  You need to delete your current taxonomies and recreate them in the new version for this error to go away.
