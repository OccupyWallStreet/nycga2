= Introduction to WangGuard: =


[wpvideo RGdn6YSg]


It is very important to use WangGuard at least for a week, reporting your site's unwanted users as sploggers from the Users panel.

WangGuard will learn at that time to protect your site from sploggers in a much more effective way.

WangGuard protects each web site in a personalized way using information provided by Administrators who report sploggers world-wide, that's why it's very important that you report your sploggers to WangGuard.

The longer you use WangGuard, the more effective it will become.

Upon user registration, WangGuard will check against a centralized database if the user is a Splogger or spam-user. If WangGuard determines that the user is a Splogger, WangGuard won't allow the registration on your site.

No need to put any kind of filter in the user registration page (eg captcha). This is the greatness of WangGuard, not hinder users who wish to register on your site with Captchas and other things that just makes the registration being more difficult and in many cases do not stop Sploggers.

Obtain a new API KEY for your site from [WangGuard](http://www.wangguard.com/getapikey), then go to "configuration" on the "WangGuard" tab and paste the provided API KEY to activate WangGuard.

This step is not necessary, but if you want anyway, create the security questions that will appear randomly in the user registration page.

You can create or modify security questions and answers from the Admin panel.

Please go to WangGuard Wizard and use it.

Upon user registration, WangGuard will check against a centralized database if the user is a Splogger or spam-user. If WangGuard determines that the user is a Splogger, WangGuard won't allow the registration on your site.

You, as Admin, will be able to report existing SPloggers to WangGuard from the Admin panel.

If you flag a user as "spam", from either WordPress or BuddyPress, the user will be automatically reported as Splogger to WangGuard.

If you flag manually a user as Splogger, the user will be reported to WangGuard and also will be deleted from your WordPress, also, when multisite or network are enabled, the user's blogs will be flagged as "spam" blogs.
