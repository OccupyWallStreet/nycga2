Upon user registration, WangGuard will check against a centralized database if the user is a Splogger or spam-user. If WangGuard determines that the user is a Splogger, WangGuard won't allow the registration on your site.

No need to put any kind of filter in the user registration page (eg captcha). This is the greatness of WangGuard, not hinder users who wish to register on your site with Captchas and other things that just makes the registration being more difficult and in many cases do not stop Sploggers.
