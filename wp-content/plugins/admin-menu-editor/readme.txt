Lets you edit the WordPress admin menu. You can re-order, hide or rename menus, add custom menus and more. 

== Description ==
Admin Menu Editor lets you manually edit the Dashboard menu. You can reorder the menus, show/hide specific items, change access rights, and more.

**Features**

* Edit menu title, access rights, URL, icon and so on. 
* Sort menu items via drag & drop.
* Hide/show any menu or menu item. A hidden menu is invisible to all users, including administrators.
* Move a menu item to a different submenu. 
* Create custom menus that point to any part of the Dashboard or an external URL.

The [Pro version](http://w-shadow.com/AdminMenuEditor/) lets you set per-role [menu permissions](http://w-shadow.com/admin-menu-editor-pro/documentation/permissions/), hide a menu from everyone except a specific user, export your admin menu, drag items between menu levels, make menus open in a new window and more.

**Notes**

* If you delete any of the default menus they will reappear after saving. This is by design. To get rid of a menu for good, either hide it or set it's access rights to a higher level.
* In the free version, you can't lower a menu's required access rights, but you can change them to be more restrictive.
* In case of emergency, you can reset the menu configuration back to the default by going to http://example.com/wp-admin/?reset\_admin\_menu=1

== Installation ==

**Normal installation**

1. Download the admin-menu-editor.zip file to your computer.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Upload the `admin-menu-editor` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

That's it. You can access the the menu editor by going to *Settings -> Menu Editor*. The plugin will automatically load your current menu configuration the first time you run it.

**WP MultiSite installation**

If you have WordPress set up in multisite ("Network") mode, you can also install Admin Menu Editor as a global plugin. This will enable you to edit the Dashboard menu for all sites and users at once.

1. Download the admin-menu-editor.zip file to your computer.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Create a new directory named `mu-plugins` in your site's `wp-content` directory (unless it already exists).
1. Upload the `admin-menu-editor` directory to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.
1. Move `admin-menu-editor-mu.php` from `admin-menu-editor/includes` to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.

Plugins installed in the `mu-plugins` directory are treated as "always on", so you don't need to explicitly activate the menu editor. Just go to *Settings -> Menu Editor* and start customizing your admin menu :)

*Notes* 
* Instead of installing Admin Menu Editor in `mu-plugins`, you can also install it normally and then activate it globally via "Network Activate". However, this will make the plugin visible to normal users when it is inactive (e.g. during upgrades).
* When Admin Menu Editor is installed in `mu-plugins` or activated via "Network Activate", only the "super admin" user can access the menu editor page. Other users will see the customized Dashboard menu, but be unable to edit it.
* It is currently not possible to install Admin Menu Editor as both a normal and global plugin on the same site.
