Thanks for downloading unified search.

To make it work, please follow the following steps.
1. Copy "search-loop.php" and search-single.php" to bp-default  or your child theme
2. Copy the contents of functions.php and append it in your theme's functions.php(make sure to adjust the begining/ending php tag to avoid error) 

That's it.
you may need to tweak your style.css a little bit to make it look nice :)
