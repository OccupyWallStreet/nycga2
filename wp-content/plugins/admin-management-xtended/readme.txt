Adds AJAX-driven options to some admin management pages with CMS-known functions without having to open the edit screens.

== Description ==

As a whole, the new WordPress Admin panel is organized fairly well, however when it comes to editing posts or pages quickly without having to open each post or page in a new tab or window, it isn't a very efficient process. For those who are using **WordPress as a CMS**, it's important to be able to manage contents easily and quickly. That's what this plugin helps to do.

It adds some icons to the posts/pages management panel with **AJAX-driven** CMS-known functions like toggling post/page visibility, changing publication date and title **without having to open the edit screens or reload the page**, **plus changing page order with drag'n'drop**, inline category management and inline tag management, plus much more.
