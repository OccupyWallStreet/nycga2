Instant switching between user accounts in WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to quickly swap between user accounts in WordPress at the click of a button. You'll be instantly logged out and logged in as your desired user. This is handy for test environments where you regularly log out and in between different accounts, or for adminstrators of sites who need to switch between multiple accounts.

= Features =

 * Switch users: Instantly switch to any user account from the *Users* screen.
 * Switch back: Instantly switch back to your originating account.
 * Switch off: Log out of your account but retain the ability to instantly switch back in again.
 * It's completely secure (see the *Security* section below).
 * Compatible with WordPress, WordPress Multisite and BuddyPress.

= Security =

 * Only users with the ability to edit other users can switch user accounts (by default this is only Administrators). Lower level users cannot switch accounts.
 * User switching is protected with the WordPress nonce security system, meaning only those who are allowed to switch users can switch.
 * Full support for administration over SSL (if applicable).
 * Passwords are not (and cannot be) revealed.

== Installation ==

You can install this plugin directly from your WordPress dashboard:

 1. Go to the *Plugins* menu and click *Add New*.
 2. Search for *User Switching*.
 3. Click *Install Now* next to the User Switching plugin.
 4. Activate the plugin.

Alternatively, see the guide to [Manually Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Usage =

Visit the *Users* menu in WordPress and you'll see a *Switch To* link next to each user. Clicking this will immediately switch you into that user account. Once switched, you can switch back to your originating account via the *Switch back* link on each dashboard screen and in your profile menu in the WordPress toolbar.

See the FAQ for information about the *Switch Off* feature.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does "Switch off" mean? =

Switching off logs you out of your account but retains your user ID in an authorisation cookie so you can switch straight back without having to log in again manually. It's akin to switching to no user, and being able to switch back.

The *Switch Off* link can be found in your profile menu in the WordPress toolbar. Once you've switched off you'll see a *Switch back* link in the footer of your site.

= Does this plugin work with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes, and you'll also be able to switch users from the Users screen in Network Admin.

= Does this plugin work with BuddyPress? =

Yes, and you'll also be able to switch users from the Members screens.

= Does this work as a mu-plugin? =

Yes, but you'll need to install `user-switching.php` into the root of your `mu-plugins` directory, not in the `user-switching` subdirectory. This is a restriction of WordPress.

= What capability does a user need in order to switch accounts? =

A user needs the `edit_users` capability in order to switch user accounts. By default only Administrators have this capability, and with Multisite enabled only Super Admins have this capability.

= Can regular admins on Multisite installs switch accounts? =

No. This can be enabled though by installing the [User Switching for Regular Admins](https://github.com/johnbillion/user-switching-for-regular-admins) plugin.

= Are any hooks called when users switch accounts? =

Yes. When a user switches to another account, the `switch_to_user` hook is called with the new and old user IDs passed as parameters.

When a user switches back to their original account, the `switch_back_user` hook is called with the new (original) and old user IDs passed as parameters.

When a user switches off, the `switch_off_user` hook is called with the old user ID as a parameter.
