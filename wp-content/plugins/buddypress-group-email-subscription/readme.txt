== Description ==

This powerful plugin allows people to receive email notifications of group activity, especially forum posts. Weekly or daily digests available. Each user can choose how they want to subscribe to their groups. The plugin works for hundreds of groups and users. Tested up to BuddyPress 1.5.5.

NEW IN VERSION 3.1:
* Added the ability to unsubscribe from single group notifications directly from the email without needing to be logged in (enabled by default).
* Added the ability to unsubscribe from all group email notifications, this feature needs to be enabled in the plugin admin page.
* Added a new group welcome email that gets sent out the moment someone joins a group - regardless of the email subscription setting. Set this message in the group admin -> email options page.

EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS
There are 5 levels of email subscription options:
1. No Email - Read this group on the web
2. Weekly Summary Email - A summary of new topics each week
3. Daily Digest Email - All the day's activity bundled into a single email
4. New Topics Email - Send new topics as they arrive (but don't send replies)
5. All Email - Send all group activity as it arrives

DEFAULT SUBSCRIPTION STATUS
Group admins can choose one of the 5 subscription levels as a default that gets applied when new members join.

DIGEST AND SUMMARY EMAILS
The daily digest email is sent every morning and contains all the emails from all the groups a user is subscribed to. The digest begins with a helpful topic summary. The weekly summary email contains just the topic titles from the past week. Summary and digest timing can be configured in the back end. (The admin can view a sample of the digests and summaries in the queue by going adding this to your url: mydomain.com/sum=1. This won't send emails just show what will be sent)

HTML EMAILS
The digest and summary emails are sent out in multipart HTML and plain text email format. This makes the digest much more readable with better links. The email is multipart so users who need only plain text will get plain text.

EMAILS FOR TOPICS I'VE STARTED OR COMMENTED ON
Users receive email notifications when someone replies to a topic they create or comment on (similar to Facebook). This happens whether they are subscribed or not. Users can control this behaviour in their notifications page.

TOPIC FOLLOW AND MUTE
Users who are not fully subscribed to a group (ie. maybe they are on digest) can choose to get immediate email updates for specific topic threads. Any subsequent replies to that thread will be emailed to them. In an opposite way, users who are fully subscribed to a group but want to stop getting emails from a specific (perhaps annoying) thread can choose to mute that topic.

ADMIN NOTIFICATION
Group admins can send out an email to all group members from the group's admin section. The email will be sent to all group members regardless of subscription status. This feature is helpful to quickly communicate to the whole group, but it should be used with caution.

MOVING AN EXISTING SITE
Site admins can reset the subscription level for CURRENT group members by clicking the link at the bottom of the manage members admin page.

SPAM PROTECTION
To protect against spam, you can set a minimum number of days users need to be registered before their group activity will be emailed to other users. This feature is off by default, but can be enabled in the admin.

GROUP ADMINS CAN SET SUBSCRIPTION LEVEL
Group admins can set the subscription level for existing users in the manage members admin page - either one by one or all at once.

INTERNATIONALIZATION
The plugin is fully internationalized (thanks to chestnut_jp) Please send language po and mo files to deryk@bluemandala.com and i'll include them.

NOTE TO PLUGIN AUTHORS
If your plugin posts updates to the standard BuddyPress activity stream, then group members who are subscribed via 3. Daily Digest and 5. All Email will get your updates automatically. However people subscribed as 2. Weekly Summary and 4. New Topic will not. If you feel some of your plugin's updates are very important and want to make sure all subscribed members them, then you can filter  'ass_this_activity_is_important' and return TRUE when $type matches your activity. See the ass_this_activity_is_important() function in bp-activity-subscription-functions.php for code you can copy and use. An example: adding a new wiki page would be considered important and should be filtered in, whereas a comment on a wiki page would be less important and should not be hooked in.
