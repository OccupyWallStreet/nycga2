Adds simple, clean links so users can login/logout & register easily. Highly customisable, & can be used as a widget or inserted into your site's PHP. Many translations available.

== Description ==

The WordPress "Meta" widget uses a lot of screen space and presents more information than some site designers would like. The Login/Logout plugin provides web designers with a compact alternative.

Available translations: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Dutch, Polish, Norwegian and Persian.

The plugin can be used as a widget in themes that include sidebars. Alternatively, it can be added to your site's footer or any other part of the site by inserting "rh_hype_lilo(); into your site's PHP.

When the user is not logged in, the plugin presents a link so the user can Login, and an option allows another link to Register. Once logged in, users are redirected back to the page they came from. The plugin also displays the username and has an option to also display their email address.

There is also a link to Logout and, depending on the user's role, a link to their profile or to the main site administration pages. Users are redirected back to the page they came from after they logout.

When used as a widget, a hyperlink option enables the widget to display an arbitrary number of hyperlinks to other sites/pages. These links are displayed only to logged in users. Other options enable the appearance of the widget to be customized to suit the theme design.

You must logout and in again to see changes such as new links etc. in the widget.
