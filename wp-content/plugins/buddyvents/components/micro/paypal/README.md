# PayPal Digital Goods for Express Checkout PHP Library

PayPal's Digital Goods for Express Checkout service is a wonderful payment solution with disjointed documentation and an unfortunately verbose name.

This class connects the dots in documentation and offers a library for using the [PayPal Digital Goods API](https://merchant.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/digital_goods) that is friendly to humans.

The library can be used to create both one off purchases and recurring payments (subscriptions).

To see the library in action, visit my [PayPal Digital Goods Demo](http://paypal.brentshepherd.com/)


## Why Use a Class

Using a distinct class for interacting with PayPal provides all the advantages you've come to love of Object-Oriented programming:

* **Abstraction**: the complexity of the PayPal NVP API is hidden behind simple function calls for common operations.
* **Encapsulation**: update your application to use the most recent version of the API without changing your application's code.

# Usage

### Configuration

Before creating a payment, you need to register a few settings with the `PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration` class. 

The minimum configuration settings required are your PayPal API Credentials, a return URI and cancel URI.

```php
<?php 
require_once( 'paypal-digital-goods.class.php' );

PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::username( 'PAYPAL_API_USERNAME' );
PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::password( 'PAYPAL_API_PASSWORD' );
PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::signature( 'PAYPAL_API_SIGNATURE' );

PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::return_url( 'http://example.com/return.php?paypal=paid' );
PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::cancel_url( 'http://example.com/return.php?paypal=cancel' );
?>
```

Once the PayPal library is configured, you can create a Purchase or Subscription object, or a few of each if you prefer. 


### Creating a Purchase Object

The `PayPal_Purchase` class is used to create digital goods purchases. The class's constructor takes a multi-dimensional array of named parameters to customise the purchase to your needs. The individual parameters are explained in detail in the constructor's comments. 

Below is a quick example which creates a purchase of two different goods with a total transaction value of $12.00. 

```php
<?php 
require_once( 'paypal-purchase.class.php' );

$purchase_details = array(
	'name'        => 'Digital Good Purchase Example',
	'description' => 'Example Digital Good Purchase',
	'amount'      => '12.00',
	'items'       => array(
		array( // First item
			'item_name'        => 'First item name',
			'item_description' => 'This is a description of the first item in the cart, it costs $9.00',
			'item_amount'      => '9.00',
			'item_tax'         => '1.00',
			'item_quantity'    => 1,
			'item_number'      => 'XF100',
		),
		array( // Second item
			'item_name'        => 'Second Item',
			'item_description' => 'This is a description of the SECOND item in the cart, it costs $1.00 but there are 3 of them.',
			'item_amount'      => '1.00',
			'item_tax'         => '0.50',
			'item_quantity'    => 3,
			'item_number'      => 'XJ100',
		),
	)
);

$paypal_purchase = new PayPal_Purchase( $purchase_details );
?>
```

These are the purchase details used in the [PayPal Digital Goods PHP Examples](https://github.com/thenbrent/paypal-digital-goods-php-examples/) repository.


### Creating a Subscription

The `PayPal_Subscription` class is used to create recurring payments for digital goods. Much like the `PayPal_Purchase` class, the `PayPal_Subscription` class's constructor takes a multi-dimensional array of named parameters to customise the subscription to your needs. The individual parameters are explained in detail in the constructor's comments. 

Below is a quick example which creates a $2/week subscription for 4 weeks with a $10.00 sign-up fee. 

```php
<?php 
$subscription_details = array(
	'description'        => 'Example Subscription: $10 sign-up fee then $2/week for the next four weeks.',
	'initial_amount'     => '10.00',
	'amount'             => '2.00',
	'period'             => 'Week',
	'frequency'          => '1', 
	'total_cycles'       => '4',
);

$paypal_subscription = new PayPal_Subscription( $subscription_details );
?>
```

Note, it is highly recommend you include the subscription amounts and details in the `'description'` parameter as PayPal does not display the subscription details on the confirmation page.


### Adding the PayPal Buy Button

Once you have created a purchase or subscription object, the rest is simple. 

Add the following line to your checkout or payment page. It will add all necessary scripts and set-up the transaction with PayPal. 

```php
<?php $paypal_purchase->print_buy_button(); ?>
```

### Processing a Payment and Starting a Subscription

When a user returns from PayPal, processing their payment or starting their subscription is also a one line operation. 


#### Process a Payment 

To process a payment once a user has authorized the purchase with PayPal, call the `process_payment()` operation on your `PayPal_Purchase` object.

```php
<?php $paypal_purchase->process_payment(); ?>
```


#### Start a Subscription 

To start a subscription after a user has authorized the recurring payment plan with PayPal, call the `start_subscription()` operation on your `PayPal_Subscription` object.

```php
<?php $paypal_subscription->start_subscription(); ?>
```


### From Sandbox to a Live Environment

By default, the library uses the PayPal Sandbox. Switching from the Sandbox to the live PayPal site is easy, set the `environment` configuration setting to `live`.

```php
<?php PayPal_Digital_Goods_Configuration::environment( 'live' ); ?>
```


## Supported PayPal Operations

Supported PayPal API Operations:

* `SetExpressCheckout` via `request_checkout_token()`
* `GetExpressCheckoutDetails` via `get_checkout_details()`
* `DoExpressCheckoutPayment` via `process_payment()`
* `GetTransactionDetails` via `get_transaction_details( $transaction_id )`
* `CreateRecurringPaymentsProfile` via `start_subscription()`
* `GetRecurringPaymentsProfileDetails` via `get_profile_details( $profile_id )`


## Using the Library as a Git Submodule

To use the library as a [submodule](http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html) in your application's main git repository, use the following command:

	# Add the PayPal Library as a submodule
	git submodule add git://github.com/thenbrent/paypal-digital-goods.git paypal-digital-goods

When cloning your application's Git repo, be sure to specify the --recursive option to include the contents of the PayPal submodule.

	# Clone my application and all submodules 
	git clone --recursive git://github.com/username/app-name.git
