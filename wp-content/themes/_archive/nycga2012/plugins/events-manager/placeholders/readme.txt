This folder has files containing some of the more complex placeholders output information.

Files in this folder are loaded automatically by the corresponding object and make certain variables available to them (see individual files for examples).

Any of these files in this folder can be individually overriden in your theme folder, making it upgrade safe without having to hack core plugin files directly.

To override a file, copy (not move) the file to wp-content/themes/yourtheme/plugins/events-manager/placeholders/ and edit as needed. 

If the file is within a subfolder of this directory, create that subdirectory in your theme path above and copy the file there.

Whilst we intend to keep changes to a minimum, it may be inevitable that we need to update these files to add new features or fix a 
reported bug, please keep this in mind when updating.
