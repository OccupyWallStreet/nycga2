WP-Featured Content Slider is a must have Plugin to smoothly show unlimited Posts/Pages in a nice jQuery Slideshow.

== Description ==

WP Featured Content Slider is a very powerful WordPress Slideshow. You can feature as many Posts and Pages as you want. You can define a picture for every single post/page which will then be automatically cropped to the right resolution (using Wordpress build-in thumbnail function). WP-Featured Content Slider comes with a great option set. You can even define sliding effects such as "fade" or "slideRight" and many more. Furthermore you can adjust timeout and many Layout and Design Options (adjust image size, slider size and more). Inserting Posts/Pages to WP-Featured Content Slider is as easy as one can imagine. Simply choose “Feature in WP-Featured Content Slider” when editing a post/page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I insert the Slider? =

You can Insert the Slider almost everywhere you want (it looks best under Navigation Bar)!

= Where can I edit the Stylesheet? =

You don't have to edit the Stylesheet you can make changes directly in your Administration Panel (Settings --> WP Featured Content Slider)

= What is perfect Resolution for the Images?

You don't have to mind the resolutions. Pictures will be cropped automatically so that they fit the Slideshow!

= Thumbnails are not being generated?

We are not using timthumb anymore - Thumbnails are being automatically generated with Wordpress, when you are uploading an image. If you are already having pictures set you have to regenerate thumbnails using the "regenerate thumbnails plugin", otherwise old thumbnails won't display.
