* Three widget areas (left sidebar, right sidebar, footer widgets)
* Optionally use custom or no sidebars in pages
* Use a wide content column. Useful for e.g. photo blogs.

You may add also a custom header message and/or footer message and choose if to

If need to do any customizations that requires that you modify the code then
please use a child theme.
